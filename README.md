Jupyter Notebooks and NWP/satellite datasets for the 7 August 2023 DMV Squall Line study
During the afternoon of 7 August 2023, an area of intense thunderstorms developed into a squall line over the Appalachian Mountain region of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania along a low-pressure trough ahead of a strong cold front. The squall line tracked eastward, further intensified in a highly unstable air mass over the Maryland and Virginia Piedmont region, and produced numerous strong downbursts (thunderstorm downdraft-induced straight-line winds). A significant downburst of the squall line event impacted the city of Westminster, Maryland, resulting in widespread tree damage and more than 30 fallen utility poles in which live electrical wires fell on about 34 vehicles. The sounding intercomparison illustrates close agreement in mid-afternoon (1400 EDT) vertical temperature and moisture patterns and significant convective instability with elevated storm outflow wind potential, thus providing good lead time (three hours) to anticipate hazardous straight-line (downburst) winds and resulting structural damage. Microburst windspeed potential index (MWPI) values of 3 and 4, as indicated by the NUCAPS and RAOB soundings, respectively, correlated to wind gust potential of 47 to 56 mph. At 2105 UTC, a downburst wind gust of 54 mph was recorded at Carroll County Regional Airport. Successive Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) rainfall rate product images at 2030 UTC and 2100 UTC, respectively, showed the eastward progression of the squall line and the location of strong downburst occurrence (white-circled region) at Westminster, Maryland, most likely generated by an embedded supercell storm in the squall line.
